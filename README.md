# Task Manager App - Java 

This is a command-line task manager application written in Java. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, removing, sorting, marking as completed, and even undoing previous actions. Developed as part of my first-year coursework in the BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science degree at Informatics Institute of Technology.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Remove tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Undo last task addition or deletion
- Sort tasks (e.g., by name or status)

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 11+)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Command-line interface (CLI)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java JDK 11 or higher installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder containing the `.java` files.
5. Compile the program:
